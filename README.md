A machine-learning pipeline that generates next-day directional signals (**Dpoint**) for Chinese A-share stocks. The system searches for the best combination of feature engineering, model architecture, and trading parameters through walk-forward cross-validation, then outputs a full backtest report with an Excel workbook.

## Core Concept

**Dpoint** is defined as:

```
Dpoint_t = P(close_{t+1} > close_t | X_t)
```

All features in `X_t` are built exclusively from data available on or before day `t` — there is no forward leakage. The model is a binary classifier that predicts whether tomorrow's close will be higher than today's. The predicted probability is used as a continuous signal to drive buy and sell decisions.

## Feature Engineering

Features are computed in `feature_dpoint.py`. Each group can be switched on or off independently through the search configuration, giving the optimizer a wide combinatorial space to explore.

| Group | Key Features | Config Flag |
|---|---|---|
| **Momentum** | Multi-window returns, MA ratio | `use_momentum` |
| **Volatility** | HL range, True Range, rolling std / MAD | `use_volatility` |
| **Volume & Liquidity** | Log volume/amount, volume MA ratio or z-score | `use_volume` |
| **Candlestick** | Body, upper shadow, lower shadow | `use_candle` |
| **Turnover Rate** | Raw turnover, rolling mean / std / z-score | `use_turnover` |
| **Technical Indicators** | RSI, MACD (line + histogram), Bollinger Band Width, OBV | `use_ta_indicators` |

All features use only information up to and including day `t`. No forward leakage is introduced.

### Technical Indicators (P3-19)

When `use_ta_indicators=True`, the following classic technical indicators are added:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Computed for each window in `ta_windows`, normalized to [0, 1]
- **MACD**: Fixed parameters (12, 26, 9), outputs normalized MACD line and histogram
- **Bollinger Band Width**: Computed for each window in `ta_windows`, measures relative volatility
- **OBV (On-Balance Volume)**: Rolling z-score normalized energy volume indicator

## Supported Models

| Type | Library | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `logreg` | scikit-learn | L1/L2, with StandardScaler pipeline |
| `sgd` | scikit-learn | log-loss SGD, with StandardScaler pipeline |
| `xgb` | XGBoost | Optional; auto-detects CUDA |

All PyTorch models support automatic mixed precision (AMP) training on CUDA devices and include early stopping with patience-based checkpointing.

---

## Backtesting Rules

The backtester in `backtester.py` faithfully models A-share market constraints:

- **Long-only** — no short selling
- **T+1 approximation** — signal generated at close of day `t`; order executes at the **open price of day `t+1`**
- **Minimum lot size** — 100 shares
- **Transaction costs** — buy: 0.03% commission; sell: 0.03% commission + 0.10% stamp duty (configurable)
- **Hold-day counting** — in **trading days**, not calendar days
- **Confirm days** — signal must persist for N consecutive days before triggering
- **Take-profit / Stop-loss** — optional, threshold-based
- **Buy & Hold benchmark** — computed alongside the strategy for alpha estimation

### Execution Layer (P0/P1 Features)
- **Slippage model**: Fixed 20 bps (0.2%) slippage on execution price, with optional layered slippage for large orders (10/20/30 bps tiers based on order value)
- **Limit-up/down handling**: Cannot buy on limit-up, cannot sell on limit-down
- **Suspension handling**: Orders rejected when stock is suspended (uses external `suspended` column if provided)
- **ST stock filtering**: Optional filtering of ST stocks (uses external `is_st` column if provided)
- **Listing days filter**: Minimum 60 trading days listing requirement (uses external `listing_days` column if provided)
- **Liquidity filter**: Minimum daily turnover / amount is enforced by default (`amount` column); a legacy volume-based filter is only used when explicitly requested
- **Execution statistics**: Tracks order submission, fill, rejection reasons, and slippage costs

## Installation

### 1. Create the conda environment

```bash
conda create -n ashare_dpoint python=3.11
conda activate ashare_dpoint
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib openpyxl xlsxwriter torch xgboost tabulate
```

For development and tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> GPU acceleration is detected automatically. If a CUDA-capable GPU is present, PyTorch models and XGBoost will use it.

### 3. Prepare your data

Create an Excel file with these columns (column names must match exactly):

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `date` | Trading date (any parseable format) |
| `open_qfq` | Adjusted open price |
| `high_qfq` | Adjusted high price |
| `low_qfq` | Adjusted low price |
| `close_qfq` | Adjusted close price |
| `volume` | Trading volume (shares) |
| `amount` | Turnover amount (yuan) |
| `turnover_rate` | Turnover rate (%) |

A minimum of ~300 trading days is recommended for stable ML training.

## Usage

### Conda Environment

**By default, the CLI does NOT automatically relaunch itself in a conda environment.** It only prints a warning if the current environment doesn't match the expected one.

You have two options:

**Option 1: Manual activation (recommended)**

```bash
conda activate ashare_dpoint
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx
```

**Option 2: Explicit auto-switching**

```bash
python main_cli.py --use-conda-env ashare_dpoint --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx
```

This will automatically relaunch the script inside the `ashare_dpoint` conda environment.

> **Note:** If you explicitly request `--use-conda-env` but conda is not found in PATH, the program will exit with an error.

### Run a new search

```bash
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --output_dir ./output --runs 200 --initial_cash 100000
```

Or set the data path via environment variable:

```bash
export ASHARE_DATA_PATH=/path/to/stock_data.xlsx
python main_cli.py --runs 200
```

### Understanding --mode and --seed

#### --mode

- **`first` (default)**: Start a completely new search. The system will randomly sample model configurations and evaluate them using walk-forward cross-validation. This is recommended for:
  - First-time runs on a new dataset
  - When you want to explore a fresh search space
  - When you want to change the search strategy

- **`continue`**: Resume from the latest available experiment under `--output_dir`. The system loads the previous best configuration from the latest experiment/run it can find, then continues random search from that incumbent configuration. This is recommended for:
  - Extending a previous search to find better configurations
  - Running more iterations when the previous search didn't converge
  - The search will still explore randomly but uses the best known result as a starting point

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# First run: start a new search with 200 iterations
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --runs 200

# Second run: continue from the best result found, run 100 more iterations
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --mode continue --runs 100
```

#### --seed

The random seed controls the reproducibility of the search. Different seeds will produce different search trajectories and potentially different final results.

- Using the **same seed** with the **same data** will always produce identical results
- Using **different seeds** allows you to explore different parts of the search space

**Example:**
```bash
# Run 1: use seed 42
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --runs 200 --seed 42

# Run 2: use seed 123 (different exploration path)
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --runs 200 --seed 123
```

> **Tip**: If you want more robust results, you can run multiple searches with different seeds and compare the best configurations.

### Continue from a previous run

```bash
python main_cli.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.xlsx --output_dir ./output --mode continue --runs 100
```

### Update Dpoint with new market data

```bash
python dpoint_updater.py --output_dir ./output
```

The tool will interactively ask which run to use, then open a file picker for the new data file.

## Key Design Decisions

### Walk-forward validation with Final Holdout
The optimizer evaluates each candidate using non-overlapping out-of-sample validation windows. The training set expands (expanding window), while each validation fold is strictly after the training data. The objective metric is the **geometric mean of per-fold equity ratios**, which naturally penalizes inconsistent or high-variance strategies.

**Multi-stage validation:**
1. **Search OOS**: Walk-forward cross-validation on search data
2. **Selection OOS**: Top-K candidates re-validated on search data
3. **Final Holdout OOS**: Best configuration evaluated on completely held-out data (15% by default)

### Anti-overfitting Mechanisms
- **Final Holdout Split**: 15% of data held out from search, never touched until final evaluation
- **Embargo Gap**: 5-day gap between training and validation to prevent look-ahead bias from rolling-window features
- **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**: Checks if optimal solution is "too sharp" (sensitive to small parameter perturbations)
- **Multi-seed Stability**: Top-N candidates re-evaluated with multiple seeds to assess robustness
- **Penalty Terms**: Worst-fold penalty, fold-variance penalty, too-few-trades penalty

> **Note on Nested Walk-Forward**: The `nested_walkforward_splits()` utility in `data_loader.py` is tested as a standalone splitter, but it is still **not integrated into the production search loop**. Current production split modes are:
> - `walkforward` — standard walk-forward cross-validation
> - `walkforward_embargo` — walk-forward with embargo gap
> 
> To use embargo, pass `--use_embargo=1 --embargo_days=5` at the CLI.

### Trade-count penalty
A soft penalty discourages configurations that generate too few or too many trades per fold. This prevents the optimizer from converging on degenerate solutions (e.g., never trading or trading every day).

### Explore / exploit / pool-exploit
The random search runs in rounds. In each round, candidates are generated by one of three modes:
- **Explore** (~30%) — fully random sampling from the search space
- **Exploit** (~70%) — small perturbations around the current best (incumbent)
- **Pool-exploit** — random draw from the Top-K pool, avoiding single-point convergence

The incumbent is updated after every round, so each subsequent round's exploit candidates benefit from the latest improvements.

### Adaptive fold count
`recommend_n_folds()` automatically selects the number of walk-forward folds based on the available data length, targeting a minimum number of expected trades per fold for statistical reliability. The function applies a 0.88 shrinkage coefficient to compensate for rows lost during feature engineering (rolling window NaNs).

### CUDA-aware parallelism
The system automatically detects CUDA availability and adjusts `n_jobs` accordingly:
- **CUDA available**: Forces `n_jobs=1` to avoid joblib fork conflicts with CUDA context
- **CPU only**: Uses `n_jobs=4` as a conservative default for safe sklearn parallelization

---

## Known Limitations

- **In-sample final equity curve** — The full-sample backtest shown in the Excel report trains and predicts on the same data. It will overstate real performance. Use the per-fold out-of-sample metrics in the Log sheet for honest evaluation.
- **No live trading integration** — This is a research tool. There is no order management, broker connectivity, or real-time data feed.
- **Stamp duty rate** — The default sell-side cost uses 0.10% stamp duty (pre-2023 rate). Pass `commission_rate_sell=0.0008` to use the post-August-2023 rate of 0.05%.
- **Cross-ticker generalization** — The `--eval_tickers` flag uses hyperparameter transfer (same config, retrain from scratch on new ticker). It does **not** transfer model weights.
- **Deep learning model randomness** — MLP/LSTM/GRU/CNN/Transformer models contain stochastic initialization; results may vary slightly between runs even with the same seed due to CUDA non-determinism.
- **CI/CD Testing** — The project includes automated tests via GitHub Actions (pytest, flake8, black, isort, mypy). Tests run on Python 3.11 and 3.12 only.
